# 🚀 ONE-COMMAND DEPLOYMENT

## Quick Deploy (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Vercel CLI (Fastest - Recommended)

**Just run this one command:**
```powershell

```

If you're not logged in, it will prompt you to authenticate. Then it will automatically:

- ✅ Build your project
- ✅ Deploy to production
- ✅ Give you a live URL

---

### Method 2: Web Interface (Visual)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Select: `niteshkumarcpr122-alt/Nitishk-Portfolio`
4. **Settings are already configured in vercel.json!**
5. Just click "Deploy"

---

## ✅ Everything is Ready!
