REPLIT AGENT TASK: Build a complete, runnable *Next.js + TypeScript* portfolio website with a Gen-Z dark rave theme. Use *three.js (@react-three/fiber + @react-three/drei)* for 3D visuals and *barba.js* for smooth page transitions. The output must be real code and file structure — ready to run on Replit (or npm run dev). *Do not output long explanations* — only create files and code.

--- PROJECT SUMMARY ---
Name: [PLACEHOLDER_NAME]
Theme: Gen-Z dark rave — neon glows, deep blacks, electric purples/pinks, kinetic motion, occasional CRT/scanline vibes.
Stack: Next.js (app/pages ok) + TypeScript, React, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three, barba.js, framer-motion, TailwindCSS (configured), postcss, autoprefixer.
Design constraints: fast, accessible (WCAG AA), SEO meta tags, responsive (mobile-first), 60fps animations where possible, minimal bundle cost (code-splitting + dynamic imports).

--- WHAT YOU MUST OUTPUT ---
Create these files (at minimum) with full working code:
- package.json (scripts: dev, build, start, lint)
- next.config.js & tsconfig.json
- postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js, globals.css
- pages/_app.tsx (global layout + barba.js integration for page transitions)
- pages/_document.tsx (for fonts, meta)
- pages/index.tsx (Home / Hero with 3D background)
- pages/about.tsx (About / education / skills)
- pages/projects.tsx (Projects grid with filters + 3D preview modal)
- pages/experience.tsx (timeline)
- pages/contact.tsx (interactive contact form + resume download)
- components/Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, NavAnimated.tsx
- components/ThreeBackground.tsx (3D animated rave scene using react-three/fiber, with toggle for reduced motion)
- components/ProjectCard.tsx (project preview + small three.js thumbnail using Canvas)
- components/AnimatedCursor.tsx (optional neon cursor + accessible off switch)
- components/MusicPlayer.tsx (play/pause ambient synth — default off; provide a mute toggle)
- lib/projects.ts (example projects array with metadata)
- public/placeholder-profile.jpg and /favicon.ico (placeholder assets)
- README.md with local dev steps and deployment notes

--- DEPENDENCIES (install these) ---
"next", "react", "react-dom",
"typescript", "@types/react", "@types/node",
"three", "@react-three/fiber", "@react-three/drei",
"barba.js", "framer-motion",
"tailwindcss", "postcss", "autoprefixer",
"clsx" (or "classnames"),
"axios" (for contact optional),
"@types/barba__core" or typed wrapper if available (if not, add minimal d.ts).

--- BEHAVIOR & UX REQUIREMENTS ---
1. Hero (index): full-viewport 3D animated scene (ThreeBackground) behind glassmorphism content. Big name, short tagline, CTA to Projects. Subtle parallax based on pointer. Include "Prefer reduced motion" detection and a toggle in UI.
2. Page transitions: Use barba.js to create fluid cross-fade + slide + neon trail between pages. Ensure transitions work with Next.js router; load barba only client-side. Add fallback if JS disabled (basic links).
3. Navigation: sticky top nav with mobile hamburger. Show active page (neon underline animation).
4. Projects: grid with filters (all / web / 3D / ui). Each card opens modal with extended details and a live 3D preview (lazy-loaded).
5. Experience: timeline component with animated reveal as you scroll (use framer-motion while respecting reduced motion).
6. Contact: accessible form (labels, ARIA), validation, and a "copy email" button + resume download link. No backend required — show how to plug in Netlify Forms or an API route.
7. Unique features:
   - Shader-based neon gradient background in ThreeBackground or postprocessing bloom.
   - Beat-reactive elements: subtle scale/pulse linked to an audio analyser of the MusicPlayer if music is enabled (must be opt-in).
   - Keyboard navigation and focus states clearly visible.
   - Toggleable "CRT / scanlines" aesthetic layer as a theme option.
   - A small, optional terminal-like "cheat sheet" overlay that lists key skills and contact shortcuts.
8. Styles: use Tailwind for layout + custom CSS for shaders and advanced effects. Include dark rave color tokens in tailwind config.
9. Performance: use dynamic imports for heavy components (react-three/fiber scenes, audio), and next/image or optimized static images for profile/project images. Minimize initial bundle.
10. Accessibility & SEO: proper meta tags, open graph tags, semantic HTML, keyboard focus, alt text on images, and an accessible skip-to-content link.
11. Tests: add at least one simple unit test (jest/ts-jest optional) or provide instructions in README to run Lighthouse.

--- FILE & CODE STANDARDS ---
- All files must be TypeScript (.tsx/.ts).
- Keep code modular and commented where nontrivial behavior occurs.
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Use useEffect guards so Three.js and barba initialize only on client.
- Provide example content for: name, tagline, 6 sample projects (with repo/demo links), education entries, 3 experience entries, and a skills list (JS/TS, React, Three.js, Node, CSS, UI/UX).
- Provide clear README with commands:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev
  - npm run build
  - npm run start

--- STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT ---
1. Create the files listed above with complete code.  
2. When generating code, *do not print explanatory paragraphs*. Only file content and file paths.  
3. Use placeholders for personal data — mark them clearly like: /* YOUR NAME HERE */ so I can replace later.

--- EXTRA DEV NOTES FOR AGENT (implement these) ---
- Use dynamic import for ThreeBackground: const ThreeBackground = dynamic(() => import('../components/ThreeBackground'), { ssr: false })
- Wrap barba initialization inside useEffect(() => { if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { ... }}, [])
- Provide components/three/NeonShader.tsx or inline shader code for neon gradient and scanlines with comments.
- Implement a simple audio analyser only if user toggles MusicPlayer; otherwise keep it off.
- Provide a utils/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts hook.
- Ensure pages are linkable (unique canonical URLs and og:image placeholders).
- Include a minimal ESLint config in package.json scripts if possible.

--- DELIVERABLE ---
Produce the full project file tree and complete code files inline so I can run the app immediately. No follow-up questions — generate the code now.
